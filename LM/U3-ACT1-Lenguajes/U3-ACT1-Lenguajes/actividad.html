            <p id="subti"><b>UN launches campaign, calling for renewed global ambition and action for the Sustainable
                    Development Goals<br><br>

                    Public mobilization comes ahead of critical halftime Summit in September at UN in New York</p></b>

            <p>New York, 5 July 2023 - The United Nations, today, is kicking off a communications campaign to rally for
                the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap for people and planet adopted by world leaders in 2015. 
                Ahead of a critical <b>UN</b> Summit in September, the campaign aims to amplify an urgent call for ambitious new 
                action, showcase the Goals as the blueprint for sustainable progress globally, and galvanize the global public around
                this shared agenda for our common future.</p>

            <p>At halftime toward the deadline of 2030, the promise of the <b>SDGs</b>is in peril. For the first time in
                decades, development progress is reversing under the combined impacts of climate disasters, 
                conflict, economic downturn and lingering COVID-19 effects.
            </p>

            <p>The 2023 <b>SDG</b> Summit will gather world leaders at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on 18-19
                September to reaffirm their collective commitments to the Goals and the promise to leave no one behind. 
                This Summit is a defining moment to urgently put the world back on track to achieving the <b>SDGs</b>.</p>

            <p>Starting today, in a major digital activation across platforms and countries worldwide, the <b>UN</b> campaign
                aims to re-energize the conversation about the Goals.</p>

                <p>"We want to get everyone on board for the <b>SDGs</b>". Our hope is that decisionmakers and individual
                    citizens alike will feel inspired to join the conversation and contribute to achieving the Goals with 
                    new resolve and ambition.</p>

            <p>Building off the color wheel brand of the <b>SDGs</b>, the campaign uses a dynamic new visual system for its
                messaging to build momentum, raise awareness and mobilize accelerated action for the <b>SDGs</b>.</p>

            <p>One core campaign component is the call to individual citizens to take action on the <b>SDGs</b> through the
                <b>UN´s</b> ActNow initiative across all 17 Goals. From using public transportation, to fundraising for schools or
                speaking up for equality, the platform lists steps that everyone can take to accelerate progress on the
                <b>SDGs</b> and create better lives on a healthier planet for all.</p>

            <p>A curated group of high-profile influencers from entertainment, sports and beyond, the Circle of
                Supporters, will galvanize their social media communities with a combined reach of more than 80 million 
                globally to take individual action on the <b>SDGs</b> and to impress upon decisionmakers the urgency to act now.</p>
